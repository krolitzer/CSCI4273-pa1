A simple CLI chat program. The chat coordinator runs as a seperate process than the clients and facilitates communication. A seperate chat server process gets forked and execed per chat session.

To compile and run: 

make

./chat_coordinator

./chat_client <coordinator-host> <coordinator-port>

To Clean: 

make clean


Current status:
It all compiles well. 
Basic functionality is there. Start, Join, submit, getnext work very well.
Getall works sometimes, there are bugs in there that I couldn't get ironed out. and occasionally the client will hang.
I didn't have time to implement a timeout or a terminate. So a server will
exist indefinitely untill killed externally and doesn't communicate with the chat coordinator.
NOTE: It was due at midnight and I scrambled and turned it in at 11:57, so thereare probably still debugging statements and other crap that I didn't clean out.
